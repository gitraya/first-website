                <p class="paragraph indent">Honestly I don't really like programming and I prefer design and drawing,
                    but there are some things that make me even more curious and want to learn programming, that is
                    because I have a friend, he really likes computer programs, and I like seeing him being exciting
                    with the code he was learning and the results of the program that was made even more interesting to
                    me with programming, so because of him I began to think about learning programming and try whether
                    programming was really exciting or not for me, then that was the main reason I learned programming.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph indent">Even after I learned what the program felt was quite exciting but it often
                    made me confused and dizzy, but I felt the process of making a program myself was fun, and hopefully
                    in the future I would love programming, and hopefully the knowledge that I can benefit me.</p>
